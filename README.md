# smart-curtains

this is a project where I use a light sensor to open or close a curtain.
I have used :
- arduino nano 33 iot
- light sensor
- 2 solid state relays (finder 77.25.9.024.8250)
- motor on 230V
- a LED that serves as an idicator 

and i also made a connection to the blynk app. here i can see how much lux there is right now and also a graph where you can see how the light intensity varies.
and you can also use a button to open or close the curtain.
